# Default settings should not be located here. This file is only used to
# initially install a theme's "settings".
#
# Instead, the Drupal Aeon base theme uses the @AeonSetting
# annotated plugin discovery process. This ensures that sub-theme settings are
# inherited from base themes themes properly and to determine when a setting
# should be saved to config as "overridden".
